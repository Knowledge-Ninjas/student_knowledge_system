**Project Description:**

Game-based name/face learning system that utilizes spaced repetition and tracks learning progress (e.g. accuracy, recall time, other metrics for measuring skill at identification).

- System should be able to identify which pairs are challenging for the user.
- System should identify when the same person is in multiple groups (e.g. if used for students in a class, identifies when a student has been in a previous class with the user/faculty).
- User should be able to search for tags and find all the groups in which the tag is present (e.g. all classes in which a student was on the roster).
- System should support adding notes to subjects, e.g. if the student was exceptional in some way, or terrible, or any other kind of data that one might want to be reminded of later, e.g. when student comes asking for a reference letter.
- System should be able to handle multiple groups and subgroups (i.e. many classes with many sections).
- System should support search for tags/values (e.g. type in a student name, pull up picture and notes).
